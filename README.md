# OneStopOptimizer

Your onestop optimizer package that implements Binary versions of Bayesian optimization and Particle Swarm optimization reusing existing libraries for use cases of model selection and feature selection.

Only two lines of code are necessary to run the trials and get the best set of features or best way to combine models.


Take a look at examples code to see how to use various algorithms. Please update config.toml with the right algorithm you want to use. This is a work in progress watch out for more fetures and algorithms

Install requirements before running the example
pip install -r requirements.txt
